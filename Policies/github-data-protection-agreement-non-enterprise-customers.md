# Introduction 

The parties agree that this GitHub Data Protection Agreement (“**DPA**”) sets forth their obligations with respect to the processing and security of Personal Data and, where explicitly stated in the DPA Terms, Customer Data in connection with the Online Services provided by GitHub, Inc. (“**GitHub**”). The DPA (including its Appendix and Attachments) is between GitHub and any customer receiving Online Services from GitHub based on the GitHub Customer Agreement (“**Customer**”), and is incorporated by reference into the GitHub Customer Agreement.

In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the DPA Terms and any other terms in the GitHub Customer Agreement, the DPA Terms will prevail. The provisions of the DPA Terms supersede any conflicting provisions of the GitHub Privacy Statement that otherwise may apply to processing of Personal Data. For clarity, the Standard Contractual Clauses prevail over any other term of the DPA Terms. 

## Applicable DPA Terms and Updates 

### Limits on Updates 

When Customer renews or purchases a new subscription to an Online Service, the then-current DPA Terms will apply and will not change during the term of that new subscription for that Online Service. 

### New Features, Supplements, or Related Software 

Notwithstanding the foregoing limits on updates, when GitHub introduces features, supplements or related software that are new (i.e., that were not previously included with the subscription), GitHub may provide terms or make updates to the DPA that apply to Customer’s use of those new features, supplements or related software. If those terms include any material adverse changes to the DPA Terms, GitHub will provide Customer a choice to use the new features, supplements, or related software, without loss of existing functionality of a generally available Online Service. If Customer does not use the new features, supplements, or related software, the corresponding new terms will not apply. 

### Government Regulation and Requirements 

Notwithstanding the foregoing limits on updates, GitHub may modify or terminate an Online Service in any country or jurisdiction where there is any current or future government requirement or obligation that (1) subjects GitHub to any regulation or requirement not generally applicable to businesses operating there, (2) presents a hardship for GitHub to continue operating the Online Service without modification, and/or (3) causes 
GitHub to believe the DPA Terms or the Online Service may conflict with any such requirement or obligation. 

## Electronic Notices 

GitHub may provide Customer with information and notices about Online Services electronically, including via email, or through a web site that GitHub identifies. Notice is given as of the date it is made available by GitHub. 

## Prior Versions 

The DPA Terms provide terms for Online Services that are currently available. For earlier versions of the DPA Terms, Customer may contact its reseller or GitHub Account Manager.

The following terms in this DPA do not apply to Previews: Processing of Personal Data; GDPR, Data Security, and California Consumer Privacy Act. 

## Nature of Data Processing; Ownership 

Except as otherwise stated in the DPA Terms, GitHub will use and otherwise process Customer Data and Personal Data as described and subject to the limitations provided below (a) to provide Customer the Online Service in accordance with Customer’s documented instructions, and/or (b) for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer. As between the parties, Customer retains all right,
title and interest in and to Customer Data. GitHub acquires no rights in Customer Data other than the rights Customer grants to GitHub in this section. This paragraph does not affect GitHub’s rights in software or services GitHub licenses to Customer. 

### Processing to Provide Customer the Online Services 

For purposes of this DPA, “to provide” an Online Service consists of: 
- Delivering functional capabilities as licensed, configured, and used by Customer and its users, including providing personalized user experiences; 
- Troubleshooting (e.g., preventing, detecting, and repairing problems); and 
- Ongoing improvement (e.g., installing the latest updates and making improvements to user productivity, reliability, efficacy, and security). 

When providing Online Services, GitHub will use or otherwise process Personal Data only on Customer’s behalf and in accordance with Customer’s documented instructions. 

### Processing for GitHub’s Legitimate Business Operations 

For purposes of this DPA, “GitHub’s legitimate business operations” consist of the following, each as incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer: (1) billing and account management; (2) compensation (e.g., calculating employee commissions and partner incentives); (3) internal reporting and business modeling (e.g., forecasting, revenue, capacity planning, product strategy); (4) combatting fraud, abuse, cybercrime, or cyber-attacks that may affect GitHub or Online Services; (5) improving the core functionality of accessibility, privacy or energy-efficiency; (6) financial reporting and compliance with legal obligations (subject to the limitations on disclosure of Processed Data outlined below); (7) the creation or management of end user accounts and profiles by GitHub for individual users of Customer (except where Customer creates, manages or otherwise controls such end user accounts or profiles itself); and (8) other purposes pertaining to Personal Data not provided by Customer for storage in GitHub repositories or in connection with Professional Services. 

When processing for GitHub’s legitimate business operations, GitHub will not use or otherwise process Personal Data for: (a) user profiling, (b) advertising or similar commercial purposes, (c) data selling or brokering, or (d) any other purpose, other than for the purposes set out in this section. 

## Disclosure of Processed Data 

GitHub will not disclose or provide access to any Processed Data except: (1) as Customer directs; (2) as described in this DPA; or (3) as required by law. For purposes of this section, “Processed Data” means: (a) Customer Data; (b) Personal Data and (c) any other data processed by GitHub in connection with the Online Service that is Customer’s confidential information under the GitHub Customer Agreement. All processing of Processed Data is subject to GitHub’s obligation of confidentiality under the GitHub Customer Agreement. 

GitHub will not disclose or provide access to any Processed Data to law enforcement unless required by law. If law enforcement contacts GitHub with a demand for Processed Data, GitHub will attempt to redirect the law enforcement agency to request that data directly from Customer. If compelled to disclose or provide access to any Processed Data to law enforcement, GitHub will promptly notify Customer and provide a copy of the demand, unless legally prohibited from doing so. 

Upon receipt of any other third-party request for Processed Data, GitHub will promptly notify Customer unless prohibited by law. GitHub will reject the request unless required by law to comply. If the request is valid, GitHub will attempt to redirect the third party to request the data directly from Customer. 

GitHub will not provide any third party: (a) direct, indirect, blanket, or unfettered access to Processed Data; (b) platform encryption keys used to secure Processed Data or the ability to break such encryption; or (c) access to Processed Data if GitHub is aware that the data is to be used for purposes other than those stated in the third party’s request. 

In support of the above, GitHub may provide Customer’s basic contact information to the third party. 

## Processing of Personal Data; GDPR 

All Personal Data processed by GitHub in connection with the Online Services is obtained as part of either Customer Data, Professional Services Data (including Support Data), Diagnostic Data, or Service Generated Data. Personal Data provided to GitHub by, or on behalf of, Customer through use of the Online Service is also Customer Data. Pseudonymized identifiers may be included in Diagnostic Data or Service Generated Data and are also Personal Data. Any Personal Data pseudonymized, or de-identified but not anonymized, or Personal Data derived from Personal Data is also Personal Data. 

To the extent GitHub is a processor or subprocessor of Personal Data subject to the GDPR, the GDPR Related Terms in [Attachment 3](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A92%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C720%2C0%5D) govern that processing and the parties also agree to the following terms in this sub-section (“Processing of Personal Data; GDPR”): 

### Processor and Controller Roles and Responsibilities 

Customer and GitHub agree that Customer is the controller of Personal Data and GitHub is the processor of such data, except (a) when Customer acts as a processor of Personal Data, in which case GitHub is a subprocessor; or (b) as stated otherwise in the GitHub Customer Agreement or this DPA. When GitHub acts as the processor or subprocessor of Personal Data, it will process Personal Data only on Customer’s behalf and in accordance with documented instructions from Customer. Customer agrees that its GitHub Customer Agreement (including the DPA Terms and any applicable updates), along with the product documentation and Customer’s use and configuration of features in the Online Services, are Customer’s complete documented instructions to GitHub for the processing of Personal Data. Information on use and configuration of the Online Services can be found at https://docs.github.com or a successor location. Any additional or alternate instructions must be agreed to according to the process for amending Customer’s GitHub Customer Agreement. In any instance where the GDPR applies and Customer is a processor, Customer warrants to GitHub that Customer’s instructions, including appointment of GitHub as a processor or subprocessor, have been authorized by the relevant controller. 

To the extent GitHub uses or otherwise processes Personal Data subject to the GDPR for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Services to Customer, GitHub will comply with the obligations of an independent data controller under GDPR for such use. GitHub is accepting the added responsibilities of a data “controller” under the GDPR for processing in connection with its legitimate business operations to: (a) act consistent with regulatory requirements, to the extent required under the GDPR; and (b) provide increased transparency to Customers and confirm GitHub’s accountability for such processing. GitHub employs safeguards to protect Personal Data in processing, including those identified in this DPA and those contemplated in Article 6(4) of the GDPR. With respect to processing of Personal Data under this paragraph, GitHub makes the commitments set forth in the Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in Attachment 1 or Attachment 2 (as applicable); for those purposes, (i) any GitHub disclosure of Personal Data, as described in Annex III to [Attachment 1](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D) or Appendix 3 to [Attachment 2](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D) (as applicable), that has been transferred in connection with GitHub’s legitimate business operations is deemed a “Relevant Disclosure” and (ii) the commitments in Annex III to [Attachment 1](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D) or Appendix 3 to [Attachment 2](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D) (as applicable) apply to such Personal Data. 

### Processing Details 

The parties acknowledge and agree that: 

- **Subject Matter**. The subject-matter of the processing is limited to Personal Data within the scope of the section of this DPA entitled “Nature of Data Processing; Ownership” above and the GDPR. 
- **Duration of the Processing**. The duration of the processing shall be in accordance with Customer instructions and the terms of the DPA. 
- **Nature and Purpose of the Processing**. The nature and purpose of the processing shall be to provide the Online Service pursuant to Customer’s GitHub Customer Agreement and for GitHub’s legitimate business operations incident to delivery of the Online Service to Customer (as further described in the section of this DPA entitled “Nature of Data Processing; Ownership” above). 
- **Categories of Data**. The types of Personal Data processed by GitHub when providing the Online Service include: (i) Personal Data that Customer elects to include in Customer Data or Professional Services Data (including, without limitation, Support Data); and (ii) those expressly identified in Article 4 of the GDPR that may be contained in Diagnostic Data or Service Generated Data. The types of Personal Data that Customer elects to include in Customer Data or Professional Services Data (including, without limitation, Support Data) may be any categories of Personal Data identified in records maintained by Customer acting as controller pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR, including the categories of Personal Data set forth in Annex I to [Attachment 1](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A84%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C469%2C0%5D) or Appendix 1 to [Attachment 2](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D) (as applicable). 
- Data Subjects. The categories of data subjects are Customer’s representatives and end users, such as employees, contractors, collaborators, and customers, and may include any other categories of data subjects as identified in records maintained by Customer acting as controller pursuant to Article 30 of the GDPR, including the categories of data subjects set forth in Annex I to [Attachment 1](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A84%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C469%2C0%5D) or Appendix 1 to [Attachment 2](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D) (as applicable). 

### Data Subject Rights; Assistance with Requests 

GitHub will make available to Customer, in a manner consistent with the functionality of the Online Service and GitHub’s role as a processor of Personal Data of data subjects, the ability to fulfill data subject requests to exercise their rights under the GDPR. If GitHub receives a request from Customer’s data subject to exercise one or more of its rights under the GDPR in connection with an Online Service for which GitHub is a data processor or subprocessor, GitHub will redirect the data subject to make its request directly to Customer. Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request including, where necessary, by using the functionality of the Online Service. GitHub shall comply with reasonable requests by Customer to assist with Customer’s response to such a data subject request. 

### Records of Processing Activities 

To the extent the GDPR requires GitHub to collect and maintain records of certain information relating to Customer, Customer will, where requested, supply such information to GitHub and keep it accurate and up-to-date. GitHub may make any such information available to the supervisory authority if required by the GDPR. 

## Data Security 

GitHub will implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures and security safeguards against accidental or unlawful destruction, or loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of or access to, Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services. GitHub will regularly monitor compliance with these measures and safeguards and will continue to take appropriate steps throughout the term of the GitHub Customer Agreement. [Appendix A](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A21%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C720%2C0%5D) – Security Safeguards contains a description of the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented by GitHub. 

Customer is solely responsible for making an independent determination as to whether the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards for an Online Service meet Customer’s requirements, including any of its security obligations under applicable Data Protection Requirements. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing of its Customer Data and Personal Data as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons) the technical and organizational measures and security safeguards implemented and maintained by GitHub provide a level of security appropriate to the risk with respect to its Customer Data and Personal Data. Customer is responsible for implementing and maintaining privacy protections and security measures for components that Customer provides or controls. 

GitHub will provide security compliance reporting such as external SOC1, type 2 and SOC2, type2 audit reports upon Customer request. Customer agrees that any information and audit rights granted by the applicable Data Protection Requirements (including, where applicable, Article 28(3)(h) of the GDPR) will be satisfied by these compliance reports, and will otherwise only arise to the extent that GitHub's provision of a compliance report does not provide sufficient information, or to the extent that Customer must respond to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation. 

Should Customer be subject to a regulatory or supervisory authority audit or investigation or carry out an audit or investigation in response to a request by a regulatory or supervisory authority that requires participation from GitHub, and Customers’ obligations cannot reasonably be satisfied (where allowable by Customer’s regulators) through audit reports, documentation, or compliance information that GitHub makes generally available to its customers, then GitHub will promptly respond to Customer’s additional instructions and requests for information, in accordance with the following terms and conditions: 

- GitHub will provide access to relevant knowledgeable personnel, documentation, and application software. 
- Customer and GitHub will mutually agree in a prior written agreement (email is acceptable) upon the scope, timing, duration, control and evidence requirements, provided that this requirement to agree will not permit GitHub to unreasonably delay its cooperation. 
- Customer must ensure its regulator’s use of an independent, accredited third-party audit firm, during regular business hours, with reasonable advance written notice to GitHub, and subject to reasonable confidentiality procedures. Neither Customer, its regulators, nor its regulators’ delegates shall have access to any data from GitHub’s other customers or to GitHub systems or facilities not involved in the Online Services. 
- Customer is responsible for all costs and fees related to GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer, including all reasonable costs and fees for any and all time GitHub expends, in addition to the rates for services performed by GitHub. 
- If the report generated from GitHub’s cooperation with the regulatory audit of Customer includes any findings pertaining to GitHub, 
Customer will share such report, findings, and recommended actions with GitHub where allowed by Customer’s regulators. 

## Security Incident Notification 

If GitHub becomes aware of a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Customer Data or Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services (each a "Security Incident"), GitHub will promptly and without undue delay (1) notify Customer of the Security Incident; (2) investigate the Security Incident and provide Customer with detailed information about the Security Incident; (3) take reasonable steps to mitigate the effects and to minimize any damage resulting from the Security Incident. 

Notification(s) of Security Incidents will be delivered to one or more of Customer's administrators by any means GitHub selects, including via email. It is Customer's sole responsibility to ensure it maintains accurate contact information with GitHub and that Customer's administrators monitor for and respond to any notifications. Customer is solely responsible for complying with its obligations under incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third-party notification obligations related to any Security Incident. 

GitHub will make reasonable efforts to assist Customer in fulfilling Customer's obligation under GDPR Article 33 or other applicable law or regulations to notify the relevant regulatory or supervisory authority and individual data subjects about a Security Incident. 

GitHub’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this section is not an acknowledgement by GitHub of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident. 

Customer must notify GitHub promptly about any possible misuse of its accounts or authentication credentials or any Security Incident related to an Online Service. 

## Data Transfers and Location 

Personal Data that GitHub processes on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services may not be transferred to, or stored and processed in a geographic location except in accordance with the DPA Terms and the safeguards provided below in this section. Taking into account such safeguards, Customer appoints GitHub to transfer Personal Data to the United States or any other country in which GitHub or its Subprocessors operate and to store and process Personal Data to provide the Online Services, except as may be described elsewhere in these DPA Terms. 

All transfers of Personal Data out of the European Union, European Economic Area, or Switzerland to provide the Online Services shall be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses (EU/EEA) in [Attachment 1](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D). All transfers of Personal Data out of the United Kingdom to provide the Online Services shall be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses (UK) in [Attachment 2](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D). For the purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses (UK) in [Attachment 2](https://github.com/enterprise-legal/github-data-protection-agreement.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A30%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C33%2C605%2C0%5D), references to the “European Union,” “EU,” “European Economic Area,” “EEA” or a “Member State” shall be interpreted to refer to the United Kingdom where reasonably necessary and appropriate to give full force and effect to the Standard Contractual Clauses (UK) with respect to transfers of Personal Data from the United Kingdom. This applies regardless of the fact that, effective January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State of the European Union or European Economic Area. 

GitHub will abide by the requirements of applicable European Union, European Economic Area, United Kingdom and Swiss data protection law, and other Data Protection Requirements, in each case regarding the transfer of Personal Data to recipients or jurisdictions outside such jurisdiction. All such transfers of Personal Data will, where applicable, be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR and such transfers and safeguards will be documented according to Article 30(2) of the GDPR. 

Subject to the safeguards described above, GitHub may transfer, store and otherwise process Personal Data to or in jurisdictions and geographic locations worldwide as it, subject to its sole discretion, considers reasonably necessary in connection with the Online Services. 

## Data Retention and Deletion 

Upon Customer's reasonable request, unless prohibited by law, GitHub will return or destroy all Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer in connection with the Online Services at all locations where it is stored within 30 days of the request, provided that it is no longer needed for providing the Online Services or the purposes for which a data subject had authorized the processing of their Personal Data. GitHub may retain Customer Data or Personal Data to the extent required by the applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law, and only to the extent and for such period as required by the applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law, provided that GitHub will ensure that the Customer Data or Personal Data is processed only as necessary for the purpose specified in the applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law and no other purpose, and the Customer Data or Personal Data remains protected by the Applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law. 

## Processor Confidentiality Commitment 

GitHub will ensure that its personnel engaged in the processing of Customer Data and Personal Data on behalf of Customer in connection with the Online Services (i) will process such data only on instructions from Customer or as described in this DPA, and (ii) will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of such data even after their engagement ends. GitHub shall provide periodic and mandatory data privacy and security training and awareness to its employees with access to Customer Data and Personal Data in accordance with applicable Data Protection Requirements or other applicable law and industry standards. 

## Notice and Controls on Use of Subprocessors 

GitHub may hire Subprocessors to provide certain limited or ancillary services on its behalf. Customer consents to this engagement and to GitHub Affiliates as Subprocessors. The above authorizations will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by GitHub of the processing of Personal Data if such consent is required under applicable law, the Standard Contractual Clauses or the GDPR Related Terms. 

GitHub is responsible for its Subprocessors’ compliance with GitHub’s obligations in this DPA. GitHub makes available information about Subprocessors on the GitHub website https://github.com/subprocessors (or a successor location). When engaging any Subprocessor, GitHub will ensure via a written contract that the Subprocessor may access and use Customer Data or Personal Data only to deliver the services GitHub has retained them to provide and is prohibited from using Customer Data or Personal Data for any other purpose. GitHub will ensure that Subprocessors are bound by written agreements that require them to provide at least the level of data protection required of GitHub by the DPA, including the limitations on disclosure of Personal Data. GitHub agrees to oversee the Subprocessors to ensure that these contractual obligations are met. 

From time to time, GitHub may engage new Subprocessors. GitHub will give Customer notice (by updating the website at https://github.com/github-subprocessors-list (or a successor location) and providing Customer with a mechanism to obtain notice of that update) of any new Subprocessor in advance of providing that Subprocessor with access to Customer Data. If GitHub engages a new Subprocessor for a new Online Service, GitHub will give Customer notice prior to availability of that Online Service. 

If Customer does not approve of a new Subprocessor, then Customer may terminate any subscription for the affected Online Service without penalty by providing, before the end of the relevant notice period, written notice of termination. Customer may also include an explanation of the grounds for non-approval together with the termination notice, in order to permit GitHub to re-evaluate any such new Subprocessor based on the applicable concerns. If the affected Online Service is part of a suite (or similar single purchase of services), then any termination will apply to the entire suite. After termination, GitHub will remove payment obligations for any subscriptions for the terminated Online Service from subsequent invoices to Customer or its reseller. 

## Educational Institutions 
If Customer is an educational agency or institution subject to the regulations under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 20 U.S.C. § 1232g (FERPA), or similar state student or educational privacy laws (collectively “Educational Privacy Laws”), Customer shall not provide Personal Data covered by such Educational Privacy Laws to GitHub without obtaining GitHub’s prior, written and specific consent and entering into a separate agreement with GitHub governing the parties’ rights and obligations with respect to the processing of such Personal Data by GitHub in connection with the Online Services. 

Subject to the above, if Customer intends to provide to GitHub Personal Data covered by FERPA, the parties agree and acknowledge that, for the purposes of this DPA, GitHub is a “school official” with “legitimate educational interests” in the Personal Data, as those terms have been defined under FERPA and its implementing regulations. Customer understands that GitHub may possess limited or no contact information for Customer’s students and students’ parents. Consequently, Customer will be responsible for obtaining any student or parental consent for any end user’s use of the Online Services that may be required by applicable law and to convey notification on behalf of GitHub to students (or, with respect to a student under 18 years of age and not in attendance at a postsecondary institution, to the student’s parent) of any judicial order or lawfully-issued subpoena requiring the disclosure of Personal Data in GitHub’s possession as may be required under applicable law. 

## CJIS Customer Agreement, HIPAA Business Associate, Biometric Data 

Except with GitHub’s prior, written and specific consent, Customer shall not provide to GitHub any Personal Data 

- relating to criminal convictions and offenses or Personal Data collected or otherwise processed by Customer subject to or in connection with FBI 
Criminal Justice Information Services or the related Security Policy. 
- constituting protected health information governed by the privacy, security, and breach notification rules issued by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Parts 160 and 164 of Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations, established pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191) or by state health or medical privacy laws. 
- collected as part of a clinical trial or other biomedical research study subject to, or conducted in accordance with, the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects (Common Rule). 
- covered by state, federal or foreign biometric privacy laws or otherwise constituting biometric information including information on an individual’s physical, physiological, biological or behavioral characteristics or information derived from such information that is used or intended to be used, singly or in combination with each other or with other information, to establish individual identity. 

## California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) 

If and to the extent GitHub is processing Personal Data on behalf and in accordance with the documented instructions of Customer within the scope of the CCPA, GitHub makes the following additional commitments to Customer. GitHub will process the Personal Data on behalf of Customer and will not 

- sell the Personal Data as the term “selling” is defined in the CCPA. - share, rent, release, disclose, disseminate, make available, transfer or otherwise communicate orally, in writing or by electronic or other means, the Personal Data to a third party for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, including 
transactions for cross-context behavioral advertising in which no money is exchanged. 
- retain, use or disclose the Personal Data for any purpose other than for the business purposes specified in the DPA Terms and the GitHub Customer Agreement, including retaining, using or disclosing the Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than the business purposes specified in the DPA Terms or the GitHub Customer Agreement, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA. 
- retain, use or disclose the Personal Data outside of the direct business relationship with Customer. 
- combine the Personal Data with personal information that it receives from or on behalf of a third party or collects from California residents, except that GitHub may combine Personal Data to perform any business purpose as permitted by the CCPA or any regulations adopted or issued under the CCPA.

# Appendix A – Security Safeguards 

GitHub has implemented and will maintain for Customer Data and Personal Data processed by GitHub on behalf and in accordance with the 
documented instructions of Customer in connection with GitHub services the following technical and organizational measures and security 
safeguards, which in conjunction with the security commitments in this DPA (including the GDPR Related Terms), are GitHub’s only responsibility 
with respect to the security of that data: 
 
Domain | Practices 
-------|---------|
Organization of Information Security | **Security Ownership**. GitHub has appointed one or more security officers responsible for coordinating and monitoring the security policies and procedures. <br/><br/> **Security Roles and Responsibilities**. GitHub personnel with access to Customer Data and Personal Data are subject to confidentiality obligations. <br/><br/> **Risk Management Program**. GitHub performs an annual risk assessment. <br/> GitHub retains its security documents pursuant to its retention requirements after they are no longer in effect. <br/><br/> **Vendor Management**. GitHub has a vendor risk assessment process, vendor contract clauses and additional data protection agreements with vendors. 
Asset Management | **Asset Inventory**. GitHub maintains an inventory of all media on which Customer Data and Personal Data is stored. Access to the inventories of such media is restricted to GitHub personnel authorized to have such access. <br/><br/> **Asset Handling** <br/> - GitHub classifies Customer Data and Personal Data to help identify it and to allow for access to it to be appropriately restricted. <br/> - GitHub communicates employee responsibility and accountability for data protection up to and including cause for termination. <br/> GitHub personnel must obtain GitHub authorization prior to remotely accessing Customer Data and Personal Data or processing Customer Data and Personal Data outside GitHub’s facilities. 
Human Resources Security | **Security Training**. GitHub requires all new hires to complete security and privacy awareness training as part of initial on-boarding. Participation in annual training is required for all employees to provide a baseline for security and privacy basics. 
Physical and Environmental Security | **Physical Access to Facilities**. GitHub limits access to facilities where information systems that process Customer Data and Personal Data are located to identified authorized individuals. <br/><br/> **Physical Access to Components**. GitHub maintains records of the incoming and outgoing media containing Customer Data, including the kind of media, the authorized sender/recipients, date and time, the number of media and the types of Customer Data and Personal Data they contain. <br/><br/> **Protection from Disruptions**. GitHub uses a variety of industry standard systems to protect against loss of data due to power supply failure or line interference. <br/><br/> **Component Disposal**. GitHub uses industry standard processes to delete Customer Data and Personal Data when it is no longer needed. 
Communications and Operations Management | **Operational Policy**. GitHub maintains security documents describing its security measures and the relevant procedures and responsibilities of its personnel who have access to Customer Data. <br/><br/> **Data Recovery Procedures** <br/> - On an ongoing basis, but in no case less frequently than once a week (unless no Customer Data and Personal Data has been updated during that period), GitHub maintains multiple copies of Customer Data and Personal Data from which Customer Data and Personal Data can be recovered. <br/> - GitHub stores copies of Customer Data and Personal Data and data recovery procedures in a different place from where the primary computer equipment processing the Customer Data and Personal Data is located. <br/> - GitHub has specific procedures in place governing access to copies of Customer Data. <br/> - GitHub logs data restoration efforts, including the person responsible, the description of the restored data and where applicable, the person responsible and which data (if any) had to be input manually in the data recovery process. <br/><br/> **Malicious Software**. GitHub has threat detection controls to help identify and respond to anomalous or suspicious access to Customer Data, including malicious software originating from public networks. <br/><br/> **Data Beyond Boundaries** <br/> - GitHub encrypts, or enables Customer to encrypt, Customer Data and Personal Data that is transmitted over public networks. <br/> - GitHub restricts access to Customer Data and Personal Data in media leaving its facilities. <br/><br/> **Event Logging**. GitHub logs, or enables Customer to log, access and use of information systems containing Customer Data, registering the access ID, time, authorization granted or denied, and relevant activity. 
Access Control | **Access Policy**. GitHub maintains a record of security privileges of individuals having access to Customer Data. <br/><br/> **Access Authorization** <br/> - GitHub maintains and updates a record of personnel authorized to access GitHub systems that contain Customer Data. <br/> - GitHub identifies those personnel who may grant, alter or cancel authorized access to data and resources. <br/> - GitHub ensures that where more than one individual has access to systems containing Customer Data, the individuals have separate identifiers/log-ins where technically and architecturally feasible, and commercially reasonable. <br/><br/> **Least Privilege** <br/> - Technical support personnel are only permitted to have access to Customer Data and Personal Data when needed. <br/> - GitHub restricts access to Customer Data and Personal Data to only those individuals who require such access to perform their job function. GitHub employees are only granted access to production systems based on their role within the organization. <br/><br/> **Integrity and Confidentiality** <br/><br/> - GitHub instructs GitHub personnel to disable administrative sessions when computers are left unattended. <br/> - GitHub stores passwords such that they are encrypted or unintelligible while they are in force. <br/><br/> **Authentication** <br/> - GitHub uses industry standard practices to identify and authenticate users who attempt to access information systems. <br/> - Where authentication mechanisms are based solely on passwords, GitHub requires the password to be at least eight characters long. <br/> - GitHub ensures that de-activated or expired employee identifiers are not granted to other individuals. <br/> - GitHub monitors, or enables Customer to monitor, repeated attempts to gain access to the information system using an invalid password. <br/> - GitHub maintains industry standard procedures to deactivate passwords that have been corrupted or inadvertently disclosed. <br/> - GitHub uses industry standard password protection practices, including practices designed to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of passwords when they are assigned and distributed, and during storage. <br/><br/> **Network Design**. GitHub has controls to ensure no systems storing Customer Data and Personal Data are part of the same logical network used for GitHub business operations. 
Information Security Incident Management | **Incident Response Process** <br/> - GitHub maintains a record of security incidents with a description of the incidents, the time period, the consequences of the breach, the name of the reporter, and to whom the incident was reported, and details regarding the handling of the incident. <br/> - In the event that GitHub Security confirms or reasonably suspects that a GitHub.com customer is affected by a data breach, we will notify the customer without undue delay <br/> - GitHub tracks, or enables Customer to track, disclosures of Customer Data, including what data has been disclosed, to whom, and at what time. <br/><br/> **Service Monitoring**. GitHub employs a wide range of continuous monitoring solutions for preventing, detecting, and mitigating attacks to the site. 
Business Continuity Management | - GitHub maintains emergency and contingency plans for the facilities in which GitHub information systems that process Customer Data and Personal Data are located. <br/> - GitHub’s redundant storage and its procedures for recovering data are designed to attempt to reconstruct Customer Data and Personal Data in its original or last-replicated state from before the time it was lost or destroyed.

</ol>

### SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES 

#### Clause 8 

**Data protection safeguards** 

The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses. 

**8.1 Instructions**

<ol type="1.1" style="decimal">
 <li>Instructions</li>
 <ol style="a">
 <li>The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract. </li>
 <li>The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions. </li>
 </ol>
</ol>

**8.2 Purpose limitation**

The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter. 

**8.3 Transparency** 

On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 

**8.4 Accuracy** 

If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to erase or rectify the data. 

**8.5 Duration of processing and erasure or return of data** 

Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a). 

**8.6 Security of processing** 

<ol type="a">
 <li>The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter ‘personal data breach’). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security. </li>
<li>The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality. </li>
<li> In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay. </li>
<li> The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer. </li>
</ol>

**8.7 Sensitive data** 

Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter ‘sensitive data’), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards described in Annex I.B. 

**8.8 Onward transfers** 

The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union <sup><a href="#EEA">(1)</a></sup> (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter ‘onward transfer’) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if: 

<ol type="a">
<li> the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer; </li>
<li> the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question; </li>
<li> the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or </li>
<li> the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. <li>

Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation. 
</ol>

**8.9 Documentation and compliance** 

<ol type="a">
<li> The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the processing under these Clauses. </li>
<li> The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter. </li>
<li> The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter’s request, allow for and contribute to audits of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer. </li>
<li> The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice. </li>
<li> The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request. </li>
</ol>
 
#### Clause 9 

**Use of sub-processors** 

<ol type="a">
<li> GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 90 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object. </li>
<li> Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects.<sup><a href="#dsr_reqs">(2)</a></sup> The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses. </li>
<li> The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy. </li>
<li> The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract. </li>
<li> The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby – in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent – the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.</li>
</ol>

<p id="EEA">(1) The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union’s internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.</p>

<p id="dsr_reqs">(2)  This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7. </p>
